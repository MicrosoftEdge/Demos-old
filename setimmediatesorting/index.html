						<p>
							The <a href="https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/webperf/raw-file/tip/specs/setImmediate/Overview.html">W3C Efficient
							Script
							Yielding specification</a> defines a means for site developers to yield control flow to the user agent
							before
							running script. Web developers may want to use this interface to both allow user agent events and display
							updates to happen before continuing script execution and to avoid long running script dialogs in certain
							user
							agents. Many web pages use the setTimeout method with a specified period of zero to attempt to do the same
							thing. However, setTimeout enforces a minimum delay, even with a specified period of zero, that isn't
							uniformly
							implemented across user agents. Removing this minimum delay from setTimeout runs the risk of causing
							existing
							webpages, that have come to rely on the minimum delay, to break by going into a seemingly hung state while
							also
							significantly increasing the power consumption of the browser.
						</p>
						<p>
							Web developers <a href="http://answers.oreilly.com/topic/1506-yielding-with-javascript-timers/">commonly use
							the
							setTimeout API</a> to break apart long running JavaScript operations. This approach allows the browser to
							process outstanding work, such as layouts and paints, and then waits for the specified period of time before
							calling back into JavaScript. It's an important design pattern when building responsive web applications.
						</p>
						<p>
							Once the browser has yielded control it relies on an interrupt from the underlying operating system and
							hardware
							to receive control and issue the JavaScript callback. Having longer durations between these interrupts
							allows
							hardware to enter low power states which significantly decreases power consumption. By default the Microsoft
							Windows operating system and <a
							href="http://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/cpu-power-utilization-on-intel-architectures/">Intel based
							processors use 15.6ms resolutions</a> for these interrupts (64 interrupts per second). This allows Intel
							based
							processors to enter their lowest power state. For this reason web developers have traditionally only been
							able
							to achieve 64 callbacks per second when using setTimeout(0) when using HTML4 browsers including earlier
							editions
							of Internet Explorer and Mozilla Firefox.
						</p>
						<p>
							Over the last two years browsers have attempted to increase the number of callbacks per second that
							JavaScript
							developers can receive through the setTimeout and setInterval API's by changing the power conscious Windows
							system settings and preventing hardware from entering low power states. The HTML5 specification has gone to
							the
							extreme of recommending 250 callbacks per second. This high frequency can result in a 40% increase in power
							consumption, impacting battery life, operating expenses, and the environment. In addition, this approach
							does
							not address the core performance problem of improving CPU efficiency and scheduling.
						</p>
						<p>
							The new setImmediate API, which is semantically comparable to the setTimeout and setInterval API's, was
							designed
							by the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2010/webperf/">W3C Web Performance Working Group</a> to address the core
							performance problem without negatively impacting power consumption. Web developers can use the setImmediate
							API
							to break apart long running JavaScript operations and will receive a callback immediately after the browser
							has
							processed outstanding work. It's the best of both worlds - the efficiency of native scheduling and the power
							conservation of low frequencies. Using setImmediate is a great replacement for most cases where developers
							are
							intentionally using setTimeout(0) today.
						</p>
						<p>
							This demo visually sorts 250 items using the Quick Sort algorithm once per callback, making one swap during
							each
							browser callback. The more browser callbacks per second the faster the items will be sorted. While this is
							not
							how you would efficiently implement a sorting algorithm it's a fun way to visualize the impact of callbacks
							per
							second. Try sorting using the HTML4 resolution of 15.6ms per callback, the HTML5 resolution of 4ms per
							callback,
							and the new setImmediate approach of immediate callbacks. Special thanks to <a
							href="http://www.eak.com/resume.html">Erik Kay</a> and <a href="http://www.belshe.com/">Mike Belshe</a> from
							the Google Chrome engineering team for the quick sort test used to demonstrate the benefits of the new
							setImmediate API. Additional information can be found online including great <a
							href="http://www.nczonline.net/blog/2011/09/19/script-yielding-with-setimmediate/">articles from Nicholas
							Zakas.</a>
