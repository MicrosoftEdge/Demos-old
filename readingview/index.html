            Reading View Guidelines

        </h1>

        <div id="demo-screenreader-text"> The Reading View Test Drive Demo provides guidelines on how developers can
            update
            website markup so the website renders great in Reading View.
        </div>
        <br>

        <div id="introduction">
            <p>Reading view is a new feature in IE11 that provides a focused reading experience for text-heavy pages,
                such
                as news articles and blog posts. </p>

            <p>The logic that reading view uses to detect the main content on a page follows popular markup patterns for
                news and blog articles on the web. This Test Drive doesn't cover all scenarios, however, the following
                guidelines will get you started in making
                sure your site works well with reading view. See the <a href="https://aka.ms/Ivl06w">Reading View in
                    IE11</a>
                blog post for more details on how Reading View works.</p>

            <p><em> To see tips on how to ensure particular elements on a page display correctly in reading view, click
                any
                of the 3 tab “views”, then click element names in the left nav bar or click the elements themselves on
                the
                embedded page.</em></p>

                <p>Internet Explorer 11 continues to provide the best Web experience that is fast, fluid and perfect for
                    touch, across the full range of Windows devices and screen sizes. The IE11 Release Preview for
                    Windows 7
                    is <span class="link">Developer Preview</span> for Windows 7.</p>

                <p>With IE11 on Windows 7, customers receive a fast, secure browser that is compatible with existing Web
                    sites and delivers exciting new interactive Web experiences. For developers, IE11 supports the
                    latest
                    Web standards and technologies, making it easier
                    to build sites that work across devices. The new F12 tools in IE11 enable developers to build high
                    performance Web experiences, faster and more efficiently.</p>

                <p><strong>A Faster Web Experience</strong></p>

                <p>Performance matters to everyone who browses the Web. The IE11 Release Preview for Windows 7 includes
                    additional performance tuning so that real-world sites download and display fast and are highly
                    responsive and interactive.</p>

                <p>In honor of tomorrow's <span class="link">PirateMarrrk</span>, tests your browser&rsquo;s HTML5,
                    JavaScript, and Scalable Vector Graphics performance.</p>

                <p>Internet Explorer 11 advances the performance leadership of our JavaScript engine, Chakra, while
                    ensuring
                    compatibility, interoperability, and security. As we improve performance for real-world sites, IE11&rsquo;s
                    JavaScript performance on benchmarks
                    like WebKit SunSpider continues to lead compared with latest version of other browsers. On Windows
                    7,
                    IE11 Release Preview is 9% faster than IE10, which is a 5% improvement from the IE11 Developer
                    Preview,
                    and over 30% faster than the nearest competitive
                    browser.</p>

                <p><strong>Even More Web Standards and Increased Compatibility with Existing Web Sites</strong></p>

                <p>IE11 Release Preview for Windows 7 includes updates to reflect the latest emerging Web standards. For
                    example, now that the <span class="link">Pointer Events</span> specification is a Candidate
                    Recommendation at the W3C, IE11 supports an un-prefixed
                    version of the emerging standard. With Pointer Events support across the full range of Windows
                    devices
                    (and soon to other browsers), Web sites can easily build experiences that work equally well with
                    mouse,
                    keyboard, pen, and touch.</p>

                <p>The IE11 Release Preview for Windows 7 also supports the latest <span class="link">Tracking Preference Expression (DNT)</span>
                    draft in the W3C. After installation, the IE11 Release Preview prompts the user set a default
                    tracking
                    preference that Internet
                    Explorer will send to Web sites. On upgrade, IE11 Release Preview automatically preserves the user&rsquo;s
                    previous tracking preferences. .</p>

                <p><strong>Faster, More Efficient Developer Tools Productivity, Based on Your Feedback</strong></p>

                <p>IE11 includes a completely re-designed and enhanced suite of in-browser F12 developer tools. These
                    tools
                    help Web developers diagnose and optimize their apps quickly and efficiently. Having fast and
                    reliable
                    Web apps is more critical than ever.</p>

                <p>The IE11 Release Preview for Windows 7 includes several tools enhancements
                    to
                    increase developer productivity and in response to the overwhelming enthusiasm and feedback we have
                    received from developers. Here are just a few of the many improvements:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Console: </strong>IE11 makes it easier to debug WebGL content by mapping WebGL errors to
                        the
                        corresponding JavaScript location. Developer productivity is improved because primitives have
                        been
                        added to Intellisense. With IE11, developers can
                        debug multi-threaded Web sites with full console access while targeting Web workers.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Debugger: </strong>An improved file picker allows faster access to files in a complex
                        Web
                        project.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>DOM Explorer: </strong>With IE11, developers can tune Web sites more quickly by editing
                        CSS
                        property values and seeing those edits in the Live DOM without having to press the enter key
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Memory: </strong>To make it easier to narrow down the source of memory leaks, the F12
                        tool
                        now identifies what operations were performed on allocated data between memory snapshots.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>A Better Web Today, and Ahead</strong></p>

                <p>IE11 provides the best Web experience across the full range of Windows devices and screen sizes with
                    mouse, keyboard, and especially touch. Try it out for yourself with <span class="link">here</span>.
