				Compat Inspector is a JavaScript-based testing tool that analyzes your site while it runs.
				Compat Inspector reports patterns of interaction which can cause issues in recent modes.
				This allows you to identify problems quickly without memorizing a bunch of documentation
				or searching through the entirety of your site's code.
				The IE team developed Compat Inspector during the course of IE9 to speed up
				the process of recognizing common issues across different sites.
				Now you can use it too.
			</p>

			<p>
				Compat Inspector is designed to help sites migrating to IE9 mode and up,
				not those running in legacy modes.
				You may still need to refer to documentation such as the <a
				href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff986083(v=VS.85).aspx">
				Internet Explorer 9 Compatibility Cookbook</a> and the <a
				href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/hh673549.aspx">
				Internet Explorer 10 Guide for Developers</a> for some issues.
				The best pattern is to use Compat Inspector first,
				then fall back to documentation if nothing is found.

						Run Compat Inspector by adding the following script <b><i>before</i></b> all other
						scripts on each page you want to test:</p>
					<pre><code>&lt;script src="http://edgeportal.blob.core.windows.net/demos/inspector.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>
					<p>
						Alternatively you can use <a href="http://fiddler2.com/fiddler2/">
						Fiddler</a> to automatically inject Compat Inspector on pages you visit by adding <a
						href="https://edgeportal.blob.core.windows.net/demos/compatinspector-snippet.txt">
						this snippet</a> to your <a href="http://www.fiddlertool.com/fiddler/dev/scriptsamples.asp">
						Fiddler Script</a>.
						Then you can toggle Compat Inspector on and off from the "Rules" menu.
					</p>

					<p>
						<img alt="Screenshot of 'Use Compat Inspector' in the 'Rules' menu of Fiddler."
							 src="images/fiddler.png">
					</p>

					<p>
						After you have the above script in place, open your page in IE9 or IE10.
						Compat Inspector will immediately start analyzing the page.
						Note that identification of some issues requires execution of the related code.
						So you should also explicitly test any interactions known to be working incorrectly.
					</p>

					<p>
						Compat Inspector will keep a running total of messages associated with detected issues. A
						summary view in the upper
						right hand
						corner of the page displays the results:</p>

					<p>
						<img
							alt="A screenshot of the Compat Inspector summary view showing one error, one warning, and zero info messages."
							src="images/summary.png"/></p>

					<p>
						Click on this view to expand it and obtain detailed information about each detected
						issue with links to relevant documentation:</p>

					<p>
						<img
							alt="A screenshot of the Compat Inspector details view. The view has three categories: &quot;Messages&quot;, &quot;Tests&quot;, and &quot;Help&quot;. The &quot;Messages&quot; section is active. Within this section one warning and one error message are displayed. Each message contains two unchecked checkboxes labeled &quot;Verify&quot; and &quot;Debug&quot;."
							src="images/details.png"/></p>

					<p>
						Most errors and warnings also provide two additional actions for further investigation:
						"Verify" and "Debug."</p>

								Some test cases have built-in "verifiers" that emulate legacy behavior. This allows
								you to confirm the root cause of an issue before making any changes to your code.</p>

							<p>
								<b>Prerequisite:</b> Compat Inspector is opened in the detailed information view
								and displaying an error or warning message containing a checkbox labeled "Verify."</p>
							<ol>
								<li>Click the "Verify" checkbox for the issue you want to confirm<br/>
									<img
										alt="Another screenshot of a warning. This time the checkbox labeled &quot;Verify&quot; is checked."
										src="images/verify-checked.png"/></li>
								<li>Refresh the page (You will see a notification indicating the
									verifier has been enabled)<br/>
									<img
										alt="A screenshot of an informational message explaining that the issue is being verified. This message contains a single checkbox labeled &quot;Verify&quot; which is checked."
										src="images/verifying.png"/></li>
								<li>Repeat the steps that originally triggered the error or warning
								</li>
								<li>If the issue still occurs
									<ol>
										<li>If error or warning messages are still displayed, repeat
											steps 1-4 for each
											remaining
											message
										</li>
										<li>Otherwise, Compat Inspector cannot fully identify this issue.
											Refer to the <a
												href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff986083(v=VS.85).aspx">
												Internet Explorer 9 Compatibility Cookbook</a> and the <a
												href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/hh673549.aspx">
												Internet Explorer 10 Guide for Developers</a> for additional help.
										</li>
									</ol>
								</li>
								<li>Otherwise, you've identified the root cause of the issue
									<ol>
										<li>Uncheck all "Verify" checkboxes<br/>
											<img
												alt="Another screenshot of the informational message. This time the checkbox labeled &quot;Verify&quot; is unchecked."
												src="images/unchecked.png"/></li>
										<li>Refresh the page</li>
										<li>Follow the steps for <a href="#debug">debugging an
											issue</a> below to locate
											the source of each message in your code
										</li>
										<li>Follow the instructions in the displayed error/warn
											messages to resolve the
											issue
										</li>
										<li><i>Note: Also look for any "if IE" checks controlling the execution of the
											problematic
											code. IE9 and up typically work best when given the same code as other
											modern
											browsers.</i></li>

								Compat Inspector can also help you isolate where things went wrong
								via the "debug" feature.</p>

							<p>
								<b>Prerequisite:</b> Compat Inspector is opened in the detailed information view

									tools<br/>
									<img
										alt="A screenshot of the &quot;Call stack&quot; sub-tab of the &quot;Script&quot; tab in the F12 tools. The call stack contains two entries (from top to bottom): &quot;inspectorFunction&quot; and &quot;JScript global code&quot;. The entry &quot;inspectorFunction&quot; is selected."

							<p>
								Many pages embed frames, some from other sources.
								These frames also produce messages if you're using Fiddler to inject Compat Inspector.
								Compat Inspector helps you isolate which frame or frames triggered a message.
								Just click a message to open it in the "Details" view.
								The view will display an entry for each frame that triggered the message.
								Each entry will contain the URL of the frame plus scoped "Verify" and "Debug" options.
								Use the options to investigate issues only in the frames you care about.

							<p>
								One common problem is using out-of-date versions of JavaScript libraries.
								Compat Inspector helps here in two ways.
								First, it detects the presence of common libraries and reports the version in use.
								Second, it provides a "Verify" checkbox to substitute the latest version of the detected
								library.
								Using this you can quickly identify if an old version of a library is the root cause of
								an
								issue.
